		                            I'm a student at <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/washington-university-in-st.-louis-2520/">Washington&nbspUniversity in&nbspSt.&nbspLouis</a> studying Computer&nbspScience with minors in Architecture and Business.

						<p>The most recent product that’s taken my breath away is the Nest. I have taken several sustainability design classes for my Architecture minor. The problems we discuss in these classes would actually be rather simple to fix if human behavior wasn’t so resistant to change.  It’s unbelievable how much energy people use passively.
						</p>
						<p>I’ve once heard the experience of trying to develop good  habits compared to trying to ride an elephant through a jungle. Most people tend to recognize the problems with the things they use or the miserable processes they must perform regularly, but tend to either ignore them out of mental laziness or are unable to articulate their specific frustrations. Users tend to continue through these issues, almost like how an elephant might march monotonously through a jungle full of roots and branches, tripping and stumbling but never changing course. The goal of a designer becomes to see the perils ahead of users, and to develop systems that makes it really easy to change habits.
						</p>
						<p>One of the reasons the Nest is so brilliant is that it recognizes AC conservation as an elephant problem. Even I, as a student well educated on the consequences of wasteful energy consumption, constantly leave my apartment each day without thinking about it until my utility bill comes. Nest, understanding that good design is invisible, is smart enough to turn itself on and off for me, so that I barely realize when it's working.

							<p>Intuitive iconography challenges you to save energy.</p>
						</div>

						<p>The Nest is delightful. This is the X factor that is really hard to articulate, but these are the magic moments that make you love a product – things like the Mac startup sound or when Google Now gives you flight information before you’ve asked for it. Nest’s leaf interface is simple. Users can immediately see its correlation to the set temperature, and understand its relation to your energy choices.  The leaf provides a satisfying badge for doing the right thing. The system then slowly adapts to become more rigorous, challenging you to conserve without being an explicitly gamified system. Trying to explain to users how much energy they should be consuming is an incredibly difficult design problem because simply stating the information in BTUs doesn’t really account for region or time of year, and it's very hard to for a user to know what is <i>correct</i>. Nest replaces numbers with simple iconography, and creates a scale that users can understand.

							<p> Both of these images are skeuomorphic because of how they are artificially limited by imitating paper.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Nest plays on familiarity. Skeuomorphism is a term often used to slam Apple’s old stitched leather aesthetic, but few people know the term's original meaning as an anachronism in architecture. The best example of this are architectural columns, present in a steel reinforced building, that provide no structural integrity, yet still evoke feelings of Antiquity or Democracy. So while Apple has removed the leather stitching from its calendar applications, the use of a month by month grid is still a skeuomorph because it imitates the limits of a page in a paper calendar in a medium where information can scroll infinitely.

							<p> Adjusting the Nest is a familiar experience.</p>
						</div>
						
						<p>Nest’s radial design plays heavily on the fact that people already know how to turn it on. <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2012/08/the-best-interface-is-no-interface"> Golden Krishna has a great article </a> about how too many designers attempt to solve their problems by adding a touch interface causing needless complexity. The shape of the Nest almost acts as an instruction manual, as users recall adjusting the dial of their old machine. It works the way you think it does. While Nest’s energy savings aren’t that significant compared to their competitors, nobody knows how to correctly program their <i>smart</i>-thermostat, often causing more waste than traditional units.
						</p> 
						<div class="paragraphImage">
							<img class="img-responsive" src="http://julianpublicbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/Website/fridge.png" ><p>Adding unnecessary interfaces is cumbersome and frustrating to users.</p>
						</div>
						<p>Nest packages their technology into a product that is fresh and engaging. It understands the needs of people both from a technological and emotional standpoint, adapting to users behaviors and trying to improve users habits. It seeks to delight users with satisfying colors and gamified energy saving notifications, without trying to force user behavior.
